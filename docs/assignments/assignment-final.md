## Project Description

Students will create a custom web application. The topic will be _an online cookbook_ featuring a library of recipes.

Students will be provided with a library of pre-written recipes in PDF format, as well as a group of images related to each recipe. Each student will create their own branded web application that will display the recipes and provide a user interface for browsing, searching and filtering through all of the available content.

The application must use the following:

- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Git

Additional techniques, including, but not limited to the following may be used as needed:

- JavaScript
- CSS pre-processors
- Node.js
- Task runners (Grunt, Gulp, NPM etc.)

## Project Requirements

The following outline lists the requirements for successfully completing the final project.

- All projects must be programmed from scratch using PHP/MySQL as the primary programming and data manipulation languages. Use of online content management systems (Wordpress, WIX, Squarespace etc.) is completely prohibited.
- All projects must be self hosted.
- Source code must be tracked throughout the duration of the project using GitHub.
- All data must be stored and served from a MySQL database, running on the live web server.
- Projects must include all of the provided recipes, not a subset.
- All sites must be fully responsive, from a range of small to large (smart phone to desktop monitor).

## Grading Criteria

Your final project represents the culmination of ten weeks. This project will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. Code Quality
    - Is all of your code valid?
    - Did you follow best practices regarding file names, characters, coding styles?
    - Is your code legible and easy to navigate?
    - Does your code use comments?
2. Functionality
    - Everything needs to work (e.g. links, videos, audio, images, rollovers etc.). If it's part of your site it must be working properly.
3. Design
    - Is your site visually pleasing?
    - Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
    - Would you feel comfortable using this project in a job interview as an example of your skills?
4. Technique
    - Is the project built in an optimized fashion? Will future maintenance be minimal?
    - Is the database well structured and easy to manipulate?
    - Is the application properly templated, with minimal repetition of code?

## Extra Credit

In addition to the front end user interface, develop a content management system for the site, where an admin has the ability to add/edit/remove recipes to the site, all from a web interface.

## Screen Capture Video

As part of your final project submission, you are required to create a screen recording of your web application in action. This video should begin with your app's homepage, and then show the interface being interacted with. Scroll various pages, complete searches, use filters etc. Video requirements:

- duration: minimum of 30 seconds
- resolution: minimum of 1280x720
- hosting: video **must** be hosted on Vimeo

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Final Project**:

1. A link to your self hosted website project page. From this page, I can fully engage the project and have access to all supplementary pages and functions.
1. A link to your GitHub repository containing the code for your final project.
    - A copy of your MySQL database must be included in the repository.
1. A link to your [case study](case-study.md) web page.
1. A link to your project screen capture video, hosted on Vimeo.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
